# Biodiversity


## Purpose: 

This dashboard was created utilizing JavaScript, Plotly and HTML in order to help Roza with a Biodiversity project. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species found.
